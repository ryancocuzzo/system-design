# System Design Practice

Exercises live in `exercises/NNN/` with two files:
- `problem.md` — requirements and constraints
- `design.md` — architecture, tradeoffs, failure modes, review feedback

Evaluation uses `rubric.md` at repo root.

2. Create `exercises/NNN/problem.md` with requirements
3. Create empty `exercises/NNN/design.md`
4. Display problem inline

### /grade
1. Read `problem.md` and `design.md`
2. Score against `rubric.md`
3. Append review to `design.md` under `## Review` section
4. Include revision suggestions

### /review
1. Scan `design.md` files for `## Review` sections
2. Report patterns across exercises
