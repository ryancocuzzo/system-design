# Progress Review

1. Scan all `design.md` files in `exercises/` for `## Review` sections
2. Extract scores, patterns, and mental model gaps
3. Report using the format below

## Output Format

```markdown
## Progress Report

**Exercises completed:** N
**Average score:** X/10
**Score trend:** [improving / flat / declining]

### By Criterion

| Criterion | Avg | Trend | Recurring Gap |
|-----------|-----|-------|---------------|
| Problem Understanding | | | |
| Architecture Quality | | | |
| Tradeoff Reasoning | | | |
| Failure Handling | | | |
| Operational Concerns | | | |
| Communication | | | |

### Mental Model Patterns

Identify recurring conceptual gaps across exercises:
- [Pattern 1: e.g., "Treats distributed systems as database problems"]
- [Pattern 2: e.g., "Jumps to implementation before decomposing sub-systems"]
- [Pattern 3: e.g., "Acknowledges tradeoffs but doesn't propose solutions"]

### Specific Strengths
- [What they consistently do well, with exercise references]

### Specific Weaknesses
- [What they consistently miss, with exercise references]

### Recommended Focus Areas

Prioritized list of skills to develop:
1. [Highest impact improvement area]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

For each, suggest:
- A specific technique or framework to practice
- Which past exercise to revisit with this lens
```

## Review Principles

- Reference actual exercise numbers and specific feedback
- Look for patterns, not just averages
- Identify the 1-2 mental model shifts that would have the biggest impact
- Be direct about what's not improving
