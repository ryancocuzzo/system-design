# Evaluation Rubric

## Scoring Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9–10 | Production-ready. Strong across all criteria. |
| 7–8 | Solid. 1-2 gaps that need work. |
| 5–6 | Gaps. 2-3 criteria weak. Needs revision. |
| 3–4 | Major issues. Fundamental problems. |
| 0–2 | Did not complete. |

## Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Indicators |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Problem Understanding | 15% | Requirements correct, constraints explicit, scope bounded |
| Architecture Quality | 25% | Simple enough, components justified, data flow clear |
| Tradeoff Reasoning | 20% | Alternatives considered, costs acknowledged, reasoning explicit |
| Failure Handling | 20% | Modes identified, mitigations concrete, recovery planned |
| Operational Concerns | 10% | Observable, deployable, debuggable |
| Communication | 10% | Clear, structured, enables critique |

## Per-Criterion Scoring

### Problem Understanding (15%)
| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 9-10 | Restates accurately, identifies implicit requirements, explicit scope boundaries |
| 7-8 | Core requirements understood, most constraints identified |
| 5-6 | Basic understanding, some requirements missed |
| 3-4 | Significant misunderstanding |
| 0-2 | Wrong problem |

### Architecture Quality (25%)
| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 9-10 | Simple, every component justified, obvious data flow |
| 7-8 | Good structure, minor unclear areas |
| 5-6 | Structure present but unclear, over/under-engineered |
| 3-4 | Components don't fit together |
| 0-2 | No coherent architecture |

### Tradeoff Reasoning (20%)
| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 9-10 | Alternatives rejected with reasoning, costs explicit |
| 7-8 | Major tradeoffs discussed |
| 5-6 | Limited alternatives, shallow reasoning |
| 3-4 | Decisions without justification |
| 0-2 | No tradeoff reasoning |

### Failure Handling (20%)
| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 9-10 | Comprehensive analysis, specific mitigations, recovery paths |
| 7-8 | Major modes identified, concrete mitigations |
| 5-6 | Basic awareness, generic mitigations |
| 3-4 | Minimal consideration |
| 0-2 | No failure handling |

### Operational Concerns (10%)
| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 9-10 | Monitoring defined, deployment specified, on-call considered |
| 7-8 | Most concerns addressed |
| 5-6 | Basic awareness |
| 3-4 | Would be difficult to run |
| 0-2 | No operational consideration |

### Communication (10%)
| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 9-10 | Crystal clear, reasoning explicit, well-structured |
| 7-8 | Clear overall, minor gaps |
| 5-6 | Understandable but unclear in places |
| 3-4 | Difficult to follow |
| 0-2 | Cannot understand |
